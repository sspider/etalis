Tests taken into account

possible variables:
1) consumption policy (recent/unrestricted)
2) garbage collection (on/off)
3) out-of-order (on/off)

this 3 combinations leaves 8 tests for every pattern.

- seq complexity level 1
- seq complexity level 2
- transitive closure
- compound test: seq-or-where-and

A total of 32 tests are done with this framework.

Results are presented in a text file containing results for every combination.
Results have the following parameters:
time performance for a test, a detailed time analysis of every predicate.
