In our work, we use libraries from other systems. We will enumerate below some of the libraries we used in our work (and these are also referenced in our papers - see Debs2009 and CES2009).

We also use use various Prolog systems: SWI, Sicstus, XSB and Yap. The WWW interface uses the Java to Prolog interface JPL from SWI Prolog (while another version uses the InterProlog interface). Please refer to their websites for downloads and documentation.

One part of the WWW interface also uses the Google Finance API to collect real life events: http://code.google.com/apis/finance/

For comparison with other CEP systems, we use the libraries distributed by these systems. Due to licensing issues these libraries cannot be distributed in our packages. Please use the following web sites for downloads:
